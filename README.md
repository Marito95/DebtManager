# DebtManager

A personal project to explore different solutions to clear debt. This project was created purely in Java, using Eclipse.

This project uses inheritance all wrong, but it was intended to get a better understanding about Inheritance in Java, which is why most classes will either implement or extend another class. Won't suggest to do it in prod.
